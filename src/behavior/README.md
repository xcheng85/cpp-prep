# All behavior questions

## Q: Can you describe a challenging project or problem that you worked on as a backend software engineer? How did you approach solving it? 


Highly latency, coupling and low-resistency microservics based on synchronous communication pattern, polling with REST Api. My approach to solve it is to use event-driven architecture which decouples, hide the latency through asynchronous api and the resistency is realized throuch message queue. 


## Q: What is your experience working with databases, APIs, and other backend technologies?

I have used key-value store(redis) widely in my working projects. Both typescript-based and go-based client. Also I am extremly experienced with Kubernetes application developement.
