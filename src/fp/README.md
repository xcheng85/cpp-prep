# All about fp in C++

## Concept
fp: result of a function call only depends on input

pure function

effect of function only limited to the return value

## Problems

### 1. How fp could affect concurrent c++ program ? (benifits of fp)
simplify
fp: no mutation on state. (ngrx reducer)

### 2. from a function declaration, could you tell if it is a fure function ?
